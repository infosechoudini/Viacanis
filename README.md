# Viacanis
Blue Team Threat Hunting and Monitoring Tool

# Purpose
To open source blue team tools and gather input from the community. 

# To Do 
- Make this readme better
  - Add install and running commands
  - I guess code more for this project...
  
 
# Inspiration
The main inspiration of this tool is Bluespawn. I like their work and what their doing. I'm looking to create something for more resource constrained environments like ICS/OT endpoints. 

# Caveat
I do not recommend running this in Production. This tool is purely research at this point. Use at your own risk.
